# DNA-Classification-Project
The project, DNA Sequence Classification Using Machine Learning and 
NLP, explores innovative techniques to classify DNA sequences into species, 
such as human, chimpanzee, and dog. By treating DNA as textual data, 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods like k-mer tokenization and 
Bag of Words (BoW) are employed to extract patterns from sequences. A 
Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is developed to analyze these features 
and predict species accurately. The system is designed to be scalable, 
enabling future integration of more species and advanced algorithms like 
Word2Vec or transformers. The outcomes of this project have applications in 
genomics, medical diagnostics, and biological research, with potential for 
cloud-based real-time deployment.
